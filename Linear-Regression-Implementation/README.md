The following two Python scripts represent the work of Niloufar Baba Ahmadi for MiniProject2, encompassing Questions 1 and 2. In Question 1, the focus is on the implementation and evaluation of various regression models, including linear and polynomial regression, with an emphasis on model complexity and capacity. In Question 2, the code delves into the world of regression with regularization, employing techniques such as K-fold cross-validation to choose the most suitable model for prediction. These scripts are accompanied by detailed explanations and comments, making them insightful resources for understanding and applying regression analysis in machine learning.
